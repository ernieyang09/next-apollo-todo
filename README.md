Start from [apollo-server-integration-next](https://github.com/apollo-server-integrations/apollo-server-integration-next)

It can be with db service (like docker and docker-compose)

However, I want a very quick solution for demo usage. So I find a headless CMS to simulate data storage part. But the api seems very slow.

The demo includes

1. User login part(using cookies)
2. Add todo items base on user
3. Change todo status, delete todo

There are still lots of function need to be improved. (Login is a big issues)

## Build from scratch

1. Fork the repo
2. Sign up a [cosmicjs](https://www.cosmicjs.com) account
3. Import the json file in example directory
4. Run the server
